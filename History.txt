History

version 1.0 (23.05.1999)
------------------------
+ Right clicking on team/thread displays a pull down
  menu where you can do the usual operations as well.
+ Menu & keyboard short-cuts for killing/suspending/resuming.
  All other menu items have now short-cuts too.
+ Slayer doesn't anymore update teams & threads while
  being minimized.
+ The biggest and most useful improvement is the ability
  to dock Slayer to Deskbar. Slayer can be docked from
  Settings, or automatically by launching Slayer with
  parameter --deskbar (in Terminal: "$ Slayer --deskbar").
+ It's possible now to set which columns are shown
  (only name & icon are mandatory).
+ About dialog is a bit nicer looking.
+ The memory usage is at last fixed to show correct
  amounts. Unfortunately calculating memory usages is
  a lot slower, so memory column is by default disabled.
  It's however very fast to switch
  on and off with command-m. 
+ The path for Slayer's settings is obtained correctly
  with OS functions.
+ Added horizontal scroll bar for team view.
+ Removed usage restrictions. That's right, from now on
  there is no usage limitations in Slayer. That means
  you're now allowed to run Slayer in Windows95/98/NT too,
  if you can. Of course I added some code that makes it
  even more difficult to run this program in that operating
  system ;).


version 0.9 (07.01.1999)
